In a recent Q&A session, jazz musician Dave Pollack shared his expert advice on how to structure effective practice sessions. Whether you have a lot of time or just a few minutes, his tips can help you make the most of your practice. Here’s what he had to say:

## Q: What should a regular practice session look like for jazz?

Okay, so what I always recommend is breaking up (especially jazz practicing) into three parts:
1. **Warm-ups and technique stuff**
2. **Reading (song learning, transcription, etc.)**
3. **Improvisation**

I like to go in that order because I find it harder to really rein things in and work on technique after improvising. That's kind of like the dessert to me. So, I save that for the end.

## Q: When I have a really short practice, what should I always do?

So, if you have a short practice session, I say the things to always do are just going to be **technique building**, and if you're a jazz player, either **transcription and/or improvisation**. So if you have a short amount of time, just focus on maybe one or two things and that's it. The biggest thing of all I think is don't try to do too many things in any practice session, no matter how long it is. If you have an hour, maybe break it up into three 20-minute sections. Or, 15, 25, 20, or something like that.

If you have only 15 minutes to practice, I would **do one or two things**. I wouldn't even break it down. Do all 15 minutes just working on technique stuff, learning some scales, arpeggios, inverse chords, in all 12 keys with a metronome and a tuner, getting everything locked in so as a musician, you're ready to go on whatever instrument it is, whether it's saxophone or otherwise.

If you have a longer practice session, sure. You can break things up and do more. But really, I would not do more than about three things per practice session. If you're the kind of person that could focus for five hours straight, that's a different thing, but you know, an hour to two hours or less, doing only three main topics would be the best thing for you.

## Q: What's the best way to practice without a horn?

I think **listening** is the most important thing. People don't do nearly enough listening whether they have the time or not. Now, listening can be passive where you just kind of have it on, or you're listening more actively.

Listen, which I recommend if you're practicing certain songs. Obviously, **listen to quintessential recordings** of those songs. So, if you're learning “All the Things You Are,” listen to 20 different versions of “All the Things You Are.” But also if you're just learning songs that are in a specific style like, “Oh, I have to play some Bossa Nova music, but I haven't played a lot of Bossa Nova,” maybe just listen to a whole bunch of different quintessential Bossa Nova songs and also recordings just to get those elements of music: the articulation, the phrasing, and the dynamics, all that into your head that you can reference. I call them reference recordings.
