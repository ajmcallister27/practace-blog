*By EJ Barasona*

So there I was, eating my Frankie’s Pizza when suddenly I was approached by none other than Andrew McAllister, asking me to write a blog post about how to practice percussion. This got me thinking about whether there really is an ideal practice routine. The answer is that one person’s strategy that gives them excellent progress may not be the perfect strategy for someone else in a different situation. However, I managed to come up with a rough outline of some strategies I use in my practice that could generally be utilized as building blocks to strengthen one’s unique practice routine.

## The Warm Up

The first thing anyone should do when starting a practice session is to warm up with some simple singles (i.e., 8s). A good warm-up utilizes stick height variations and starts slow, gradually ramping up the speed. Eventually, warm-up routines can involve different exercises for different muscles and techniques, but even a simple round of 8s will do the trick.

## Rudiments

Rudiments are another universal aspect of nearly any percussion instrument that uses a pair of sticks. Integrating a routine practice of some of the *PAS 40 Rudiments* is a great way to practice different types of strokes and stickings that can be applied to most percussion genres. These can fit anywhere in a practice routine, but I like to integrate them into the warm-up. Finding time to practice these rudiments will most definitely show in performance.

## Genre Practice

Once the warm-up is complete, it’s time to begin practicing a specific genre. Since percussionists fill such an important role in most styles, percussion scholars often find themselves straddling many different genres. It’s highly beneficial that each one is treated as its own individual practice routine. A good practice in each genre consists of a balance of three parts:

### Listening and Transcribing

This is a *crucial* part of practice and helps one understand the genre to the fullest extent. By listening, one can hear the different elements of drumming that form the style. This is especially important for jazz musicians but is beneficial for any genre.

### Chops and Technique

While *PAS 40 rudiments* are versatile and can be beneficial for any genre, each genre has its own set of rudimentary language. Practicing this can highly benefit one’s technique and flow in performance and is crucial in working with more advanced literature.

### Sheet Music

Last but certainly not least is the actual *sheet music* itself. It’s important to start slow and work up the speed, especially for faster literature, and to always practice with a metronome. Additionally, taking the music in small increments will also benefit your understanding of the piece. **Recording yourself and playing in front of a mirror** can help you find your mistakes and see yourself from the audience’s perspective. My controversial opinion is that learning charts *back to front* is best, but it differs from person to person. If you aren’t in an official band or haven’t been assigned any sheet music, there are a couple of options. Percussionists studying a literature-based genre such as classical and marching may benefit from finding new sheet music online to keep your reading and memorization sharp. However, more improvisation-based percussionists like those studying Latin and jazz may benefit more from spending more time listening and transcribing.

## Practice Without Sticks

As much as one strives to always have sticks and a pad handy, that’s not always the case. When you find yourself in a situation where you are unable to attain implements, **tapping out rhythms with your hands, singing, and listening** are beneficial. Additionally, merely picturing yourself at your instruments and going through all of the motions in your head has a similar effect to actual practice and can improve your memory and flow. There is lots of research into that subject online if you’re curious.


## Conclusion

While percussion practice is subjective, it’s always important to reflect on any holes in your practice routine and aim to create a routine that’s right for you. Doing further research from experts and other percussionists and musicians can help guide you in finding your ideal practice routine. In the end, **some practice is better than no practice at all**, and finding time in your day to practice already gets you on your way to becoming a better musician.
