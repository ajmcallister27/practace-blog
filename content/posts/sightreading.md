Many musicians begin their journey as a part of their school band where they have time to practice before performing pieces, or they're a member of a band that writes it's own music. But, there will be a time when you don't have the luxury of being able to practice a piece for weeks before you perform it.

Sightreading is a crucial skill for **all musicians** because it enables you to play music at a level that an audience would enjoy listening to it, all without putting in hours of work on that specific piece. There are many situations when musicians show up for a gig and someone is sick or unable to play their part. A good sightreader would be able to perform that piece at a good enough level without needing tons of practice time at first. Many professional ensembles are considered "reading bands", which means that the majority of what they are playing is being sightread.

In this post, we will be going over three crucial tools that ***will*** improve your sightreading:

## NoteNames

### What is NoteNames?

NoteNames is a tool built by Brian Wis to help train musicians to recognize the names of notes faster. It walks you through 12 levels ranging from simple note identification to building scales in all 12 keys.

### Levels:

 1. **Middle-Range Note Identification** This level goes through the notes most common on your instrument.
 2. **High-Range Note Identification** This level goes through the notes in the higher end of your instrument's range, and this level expands upwards when you set your difficulty to be harder.
 3. **Low-Range Note Identification** This level goes through the notes in the lower end of your instrument's range, and it also expands downwards when you set your difficulty to be harder.
 4. **Full-Range Note Identification** This level goes through all of the notes seen in the last three levels; so, you will be quizzed on every note between the lowest note of level 3 and the highest note of level 2.
 5. **Flat Note Identification** This level covers flat notes. It gives you a key signature of all flats and you need to identify which note is shown on the screen.
 6. **Sharp Note Identification** This level covers sharp notes. It gives you a key signature of all sharps and you need to identify which note is shown on the screen.
 7. **Sharp and Flat Note Identification** This level covers both sharp notes and flat nights. This shows a random key signature and you are tasked in identifying which note is shown on the screen.
 8. **Flat Key Signature Identification** This level tests your skills on identifying key signatures full of flats.
 9. **Sharp Key Signature Identification** This level tests your skills on identifying key signatures full of sharps.
 10. **Flat and Sharp Key Signature Identification** This level tests your skills on identifying all key signatures.
 11. **Scale Spelling** This level gives you a key signature and tasks you with spelling each note of the scale in order.
 12. **Key Signature Spelling** This level gives you a key (example: "Bb Major") and tasks you with spelling each key signature note in order (for the example: "Bb, Eb").

### Benefits

The biggest benefits that come from NoteNames is the ability to identify notes, keys, and scales more quickly so that you can spend more time playing the music instead of trying to figure out what to play.
