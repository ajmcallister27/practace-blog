<p>PractACE Music is an application that assists users in planning, tracking, and sharing their practice sessions. It includes multiple features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metronome and tuner</li>
<li>Goals checklist</li>
<li>Timed practice sections</li>
<li>Community feature</li>
<li>AI practice verification</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout this article, we will go through what each of these features are, why they are important for <strong>you</strong>, and how they will assist you in your practice sessions.</p>
<h2 id="metronome-and-tuner">Metronome and Tuner</h2>
<p>[met and tuner pic]</p>
<p>Both a metronome and a tuner are vital tools to a good practice session. A metronome assists in keeping time, and teaching rhythm. It is essential in learning how to play in time and to play together when you start playing and rehearsing with other people. It is used at all points in a practice session while playing all pieces. <strong>A metronome makes you a better musician</strong>, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>A tuner is vital to every musician&rsquo;s practice because it helps them to play in tune. Playing in tune sounds better, and the better the music sounds, the more it can cause emotion in the listeners. On some instruments (mainly string instruments), once you are in tune at the beginning of your practice session, you don&rsquo;t <em>need</em> to tune throughout the session. But, for many wind instruments, a tuner is essential throughout your practice session to ensure that each note is in tune.</p>
<p>PractACE has both of these valuable tools built into the application so you don&rsquo;t need to switch screens and waste valuable practice time to use a metronome and tuner!</p>
<h2 id="goals-checklist">Goals Checklist</h2>
<p>[goal picture]</p>
<p>You will be a lot more successful in everything if you <strong>have a plan and set goals</strong>. This especially applies to practicing music. The goal feature of PractACE is built similar to a todo-list to help you keep track of what you want to practice in that session. It saves your items after they are created, so you can use the same items in multiple practices. With both a title and description availible, the goals feature helps you remember exactly what you wanted to do in your practice so you are the most effecient.</p>
<h2 id="timed-practice-sections">Timed Practice Sections</h2>
<p>[pic of timer]</p>
<p>PractACE has two main practice tracking features. A timer that counts down, and a stopwatch that counts up. The timer breaks your practice into <strong>three sections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Warmup</li>
<li>Practice</li>
<li>Fun Songs</li>
</ul>
<p>Each section is fully customizable to include the songs or exercises you want to complete in that section. You can choose the length of time spent in each section. Planning your practice session will help you become the best musician that you can be.</p>
<h2 id="community-feature">Community Feature</h2>
<p>[pic of &ldquo;the wall&rdquo;]</p>
<p>The community feature lets you <strong>share your practice sessions</strong> with your friends, <strong>recieve encores</strong> (similar to likes), and <strong>give comments</strong>. You can customize each practice session to have a custom title, and add notes of what you worked on.</p>
<h2 id="ai-practice-verification">AI Practice Verification</h2>
<p>[pic of verification screen]</p>
<p>A lot of practice time is spent setting up, getting a drink, pulling out music, or other procrastination. We hate to admit it, but sometimes we aren&rsquo;t always practicing as long as we think we are.</p>
<p>Using the power of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), PractACE tells you how long you were <strong>actually playing</strong>. It accomplishes this by recording your practice session (you can opt out if you want) and</p>
